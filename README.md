# jarsAPI
Custom API written with PHP to be a RESTful web application together with a MySQL (MariaDB) database with phpmyadmin installed (docker files still in a private repo for now)

## Formatting
In order to minimize confusion about exactly how to write in variables (i.e. if I used the dummy user/password in the files to actually be user and password that can make example files confusing) the following formatting will be used in all files and code:

### All usernames for all accounts will be:

MyName


### All passwords will be: 

MySecret


S
