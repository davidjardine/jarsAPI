# jarsAPI
Custom API written with PHP to be a RESTful web application together with a MySQL (MariaDB) database with phpmyadmin installed (docker files still in a private repo for now)
## Directory Organization
The directory is ordered as follows:
- jarsAPI
  - php_api


## Formatting
In order to minimize confusion about exactly how to write in variables (i.e. if I used the dummy user/password in the files to actually be user and password that can make example files confusing) and to enable the easy use of find/replace functions, the following default values will be used for...
### usernames:
MyName
### passwords: 
MySecret
### host IPv4: 
100.200.300.400
### admin email:
MyEmail
### passwords: 
MySecret
### host IPv4: 
100.200.300.400
